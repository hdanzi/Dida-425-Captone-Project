## Features

### Brain Games

An interactive section that opens a Twine-based self-care adventure game. This feature encourages students to reflect on their mental state while making choices in a story-style format.

### Breathing Exercises

Guided breathing activities displayed through an HTML page. These exercises help users calm down, regulate stress, and refocus during study breaks.

### Mood Tracking

Students rate their happiness, sadness, stress, and energy using sliders. Each entry is saved locally so users can track emotional trends over time and reflect on how their mood changes.

### Reminders and Alarms

Users can view suggested wellness reminders and add or remove personal ones. This feature supports habit-building, time awareness, and self-care routines such as hydration, breathing breaks, or gratitude journaling.

### Extra Help

Provides motivational messages and links to trusted mental health organizations including crisis hotlines and national support networks. This page reminds users that they are not alone and that help is always available.
